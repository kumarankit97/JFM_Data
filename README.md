This .zip file contains the data that is paet of the Proceedings of the Royal Soceity A draft titled "Spectral characteristics of the heat release rate in turbulent flames".
The data consists of:

  a. Probe time-series data consisting various primitive variables such as velocity, Heat Release Rate (HRR), mixture fraction, etc. for 5 cases 
  DLR-A, DLR-B, DLR-C, BBF and JICF.
  
  b. Sound Pressure Level data for two references mentioned in the paper (Fig. 4).
  
  c. Midplane HRR and velocity data used for DMD analysis of JICF and BBF cases.
  
  d. Other relevant data used in generating Figs. 10 and 12.
